    "#### **There are a few approaches to derivatives pricing, e.g.:**\n",
    "- **Analytical formulas** - there are derivatives for which their fair values can be calculated from closed form analytical solution, e.g. Black-Scholes-Merton model\n",
    "- **Martingale Pricing** - it is an approach that is in a form of expectations and can be numerically solve by Monte Carlo simulation by calculating expected value of the contract and discount it back to today's value\n",
    "- **Finite difference** - it requires defining boundary conditions, then it solves the partial differential equation backward in time. It discretizes the price/time grid into a lattice, solving the PDE iteratively backward from maturity using methods like Crank-Nicolson or explicit methods.\n",
    "- **Tree models** - discrete-time model for pricing derivatives. It involves constructing a tree to model the different possible paths the price of the underlying asset could take. At each node, the price can move up, down or stay the same by specific factors, and the derivative is priced by working backwards from the expiration date to the present\n",
    "- **Advanced models allowing volatility not to be constant** - modern approaches include *stochastic volatility models* (e.g. Heston model) treating volatility itself as a random variable, *local volatility* that assumes that volatility is a function of both current asset price and time or *jump-diffusion models* that add a \"jump\" component to the random walk to account for sudden market crashes or news spikes\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree models and finite difference PDEs solving are somehow connected to itself. Finite difference methods can solve derivative pricing problems that have, in general, the same level of complexity as those problems solved by tree approaches, but, given their relative complexity, are usually employed only when other approaches are inappropriate; an example here, being changing interest rates and / or time linked dividend policy. At the same time, like tree-based methods, this approach is limited in terms of the number of underlying variables, and for problems with multiple dimensions, Monte Carlo methods for option pricing are usually preferred. Note that, when standard assumptions are applied, the explicit technique encompasses the binomial- and trinomial tree methods. Tree based methods, then, suitably parameterized, are a special case of the explicit finite difference method.\n",

    "Prices must be consistent across related instruments to prevent risk-free profits. One of the fundamental principles in derivatives pricing is the notion of no-arbitrage, which asserts that there should be no way to make a risk-free profit by simultaneously buying and selling combinations of the derivative and the underlying asset. This principle ensures that the market remains fair and efficient.\n",

    "#### **Martingale pricing method**\n",
    "\n",
    "In martingale pricing standard numeraire is assumed to be money market account. It leads to risk-neutral measure where all discounted prices are martingales. However, sometimes we need to switch to different numeraire as math can be difficult in some cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Most common situation in when it is beneficial to use different numeraire**:\n",
    "1. **Stochastic Interest Rates (The Forward Measure)** <br>\n",
    "A zero-coupon bond, maturing at time T, numeraire is better, resulting in $T$-Forward Measure ($\\mathbb{Q^T}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exchange options** <br>\n",
    "When you want to price an option to exchange one risky asset for another, e.g. 1 share of Apple on 2 shares of Microsoft. Then using one if the underlying assets as numeraire is easier and reduces two-dimensional problem to one-dimensional. The \"strike\" becomes constant and Black-Scholes formula can be applied directly\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Foreign exchange (Garman-Kohlhagen)** <br>\n",
    "When pricing option on foreign exchange, there are two different money markets - foreign and domestic. Foreign money market account should be used as numeraire as it allows to view foreign currency as a divident paying asset (dividend is the foreign interest rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interest Rate Swaps**\n",
    "When pricing Swaptions (options to enter into a swap), the payoff depends on a series of future cash flows (an annuity). The new numeraire should be an annuity which is a portfolio of zero-coupon bonds, corresponding to the swap's payment dates. Resulting measure is Swap measure. Under this measure, the forward swap rate becomes a martingale. This is the industry standard for the LIBOR Market Model because it makes the volatility of the swap rate the only parameter you need to model."
