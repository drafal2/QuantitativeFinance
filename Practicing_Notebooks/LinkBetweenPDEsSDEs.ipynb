    "**Stochastic differential equation** is a differential equation in which one or more of the terms is a stochastic process, resulting in a solution which is also a stochastic process. It is mathematical equations describing systems influenced by random factors, adding a \"noise\" term (like Brownian motion) to traditional differential equations, resulting in solutions that are themselves random processes. Instead of a single solution, SDEs yield a stochastic process, a collection of possible paths or trajectories. Mathematical tools like the Itô calculus (and Itô's Lemma) are used to analyze and solve SDEs, as standard calculus rules don't directly apply due to the random noise. It has random component.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partial differential equation** is an equation which involves a multivariable function and one or more of its partial derivatives. It is mathematical equations involving an unknown function of multiple variables (like space and time) and its partial derivatives, used to model complex systems where changes depend on several factors, such as heat flow, fluid dynamics, waves, electricity, and quantum mechanics. They describe how quantities change in relation to these multiple dimensions, providing the mathematical language for many physical laws. Unlike ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for single-variable systems, PDEs handle systems spread across multiple dimensions (space and time). A PDE sets up a relationship between the function and its rates of change (derivatives). Solving the PDE means finding the specific unknown function that satisfies that relationship, often revealing the system's behavior over time and space. Solutions can be found analytically (exact formulas) or numerically (using computer models for complex problems). It does not have random component."
